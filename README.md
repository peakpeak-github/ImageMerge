# ImageMerge
Distribute your ESP-* projects as one binary file.

If you have built a solution you want to share among friends/customers but do not want to :
1.	Share the source code
or
2.	Need your friends/customers to install a complete VS Code and platform.io

Then one possible solution is to distribute the memory image of both the program partition and the filesystem partition as one single binary file which can be uploaded by one single program to the board.

Meet ImageMerge and ESPTool.exe! 

I will not take any credit for ESPTool, itâ€™s a python program which I converted into a an .exe with pyinstall to be self-contained without any dependencies. 

ImageMerge combines both the program partition and the filesystem partition as one single binary file.
This file can then be uploaded to the board with ESPTool. 

Your friends/customers then only need three files without any installation requirements.
1.	ESPTool.exe.
2.	The resulting file produced by ImageMerge.
3.	A batch file starting ESPTool with the required arguments.
